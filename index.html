<h1>The Communist <br>Christmas Conspiracy</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Soviet Revolution was completed in 1923.<br><br>  One year later Macy's introduced their Santa Claus to the public. <br><br> Coincidence?<br><br>
   Impossible!</p>

<h2>Santa Claus <mark>is</mark> Karl Marx!</h2>

<br>
<p>Yes my friends, as sure as the Earth is flat, Santa Claus is none other than Karl Marx.
  <br><br> Like Elvis, his death was staged to avoid suspicions concerning his unholy immortality!
  <br><br>In case you are still skeptical, consider these similarities proof!</p>

  <p>This recently discovered
<a href="https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/dialectics-of-santa-claus-by-karl-marx">analysis</a> of the myth of Santa Claus by Marx is the obvious
start of this conspiracy.<br><br>
Marx, recognizing the appeal of the character, decided to co-opt this great symbol of capitalism.  Founding a <i>Communist</i> utopia in Siberia where the Elves
controlled the means of production, he set to work polluting the minds of children with insidious propaganda.  Children taught they do not
 have to toil in sweatshops to aquire toys and sweets grew into adults founding labour movements and engaging in horrifying collective action such as general
 strikes.
 <br><br>
Furthermore, he used coal, a symbol of the strike breaking owners practiced against coal miners, to punish the bourgousie.</p>
